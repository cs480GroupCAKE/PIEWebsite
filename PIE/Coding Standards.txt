Close all html elements

Always use alt attribute with images (in case there is no display or disabilities)

Avoid code lines over 80 characters

HTML5 does not require <html> and <body> tags - older versions may still need them

Language and character coding should be definied at the head

Comments should be used as necessary to describe complex code

The same naming conventions should be used in JavaScript, HTML, and php to avoid confusion

Lower case file names should be used - some web servers are case sensitive, some are not

Save with the right extension - HTML .html, CSS .css, JavaScript .js
