Meeting Notes
Starting Time: 4pm

Notes for site:
- The targets will be mainly senior citizens, also for other who need an app for planning social events
- Site should be like MealTrain but with improved communication/contact, must have an easy interface
- Should promote healthy/active lifestyles by showing support
- Profiles and networks somewhat like facebook but more private - only certain members should be able to contact others?
- Wants a reminder for events such as scholarship luncheons (possibly though text or call)
- Financial schedule to show past and future costs for events
- Log of when/where events take place, maybe also pictures and other info
- Free/paid version and languages/translations (through google maybe) - maybe not enough time

Additional notes:
- Contact target groups, ask about necessities (seniors and international students mainly)
- Check yelp/urbanspoon, find high-rated restaurants
- Contact restaurants, ask about discounts (for frequent visits or group events)

Questions for Dr. Chueh:
- Ask about networks; how should we determine which mebers can contact others? by name?
- What can we do to make it more private? Would an accept/ignore option work?
- Where will the site be hosted?
- What are the core requirements?

Next meeting scheduled 10/28/15 at 4pm, Bouillon 106

End time: 5:10pm
