Starting Time: 1pm

Notes for the group:
- We can use putty to access and edit the files on the server
- We can use WinSCP to have a graphical view of the files on our server
  To find the project directory go to WinSCP/root/var/www
  "nano" command can be used to edit files (^ means ctrl -- ie. "ctrl + o" saves/writes the changes to the file, "ctrl + x" exits)
  These files are on the server -- NOT GITHUB, so if you use this, be sure to copy the files to your repository to push changes!
- To view our pages, go to cake.cs.cwu.edu on any Hebeler computer (on any browser)
- To view our mySQL tables, use "mysql -p" command to connect on putty
  commands while the databases are open require a semicolon (;) at the end of the command
  "use pie;" command accesses our PIE database
  "show tables;" command lists the tabes in the database
