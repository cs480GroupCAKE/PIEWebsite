Chueh Meeting Notes
Starting Time: 4pm

Meeting notes:
- The test server is up; information should be forwarded to our e-mails
- Adding contacts to groups will be an option on user profiles
- For event invitations, we should be able to invite groups as well as individuals
- There should be an option for public and private events
  - If private, only allow admin to invite; if public, allow all invited users to invite others
  - We should discuss admin rights; can they allow specific users to invite?
- "Networks" will be based around events
- Chueh wants a chart to show group sizes (and overlap?); we decided upon a pie chart
  - We could add a link to each section of the chart to display members of the group
- Chueh is okay with a free host for the final iteration
  - If the number of users gets large, a paid site may be necessary

Notes for Dr. Chueh:
- We can only do a limited amount by the end of the quarter:
  - We promised a site with contacts, profiles, user info database, and events database/calendar
  - We will have the site hosted (likely a free host)
  - Existing deals will be displayed (need to find a local site to populate local deals)

Next meeting scheduled January 18, 2016 at 1pm with the CAKE team, Hebeler Hall

End Time: 4:30pm
