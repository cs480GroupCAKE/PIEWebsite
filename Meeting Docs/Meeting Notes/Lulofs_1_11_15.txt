Notes for the site:
- Test server should hopefully be up tomorrow (check with Zac)
- There is a possibility of finding free hosting (check with other groups and online)
- We should be looking into SauceLabs for testing browser compatibility
- Update the template for potentially bolder fonts and add boxes/lines for login/sign up buttons
- Message people for testing (Colin) - Audrey and Alicia are potential sociology majors,
  Logan and Tonya potentially have Elmview testers.
- Header/Nav on the "about" page needs the login/sign up buttons
- Footer needs contacts, copyright, and a feedback page (up by February)
  change it from fixed to always at the bottom of the page & test color schemes
- We need to add a link to the team website in the "about" page
- Consider more tabs for the about page; otherwise take out the tabs
- PHP profile page should be completed by February
  Calendar placeholder; Events on the Profile page; There will be a new page w/ the same layout for the calendar
  redirect instead of new window/tab for the profile. Add a "back" button. Should include the name, 
  description, date, and time on the profiles (can be dummy for February oral iteration)
- Add an events page to create events - use the CWU site as a template
