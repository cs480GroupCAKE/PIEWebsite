Lulofs Meeting Notes
Starting Time: 4:05pm

Notes:
- template.css "divLeft" should be used for the profile page
- Events should have a scoll/swipe layout
- Add description above tabs in the profile page
- Add categories to the help page
- Create link and send button on the help page
- The birth date should be a dropdown menu on the register form (to avoid invalid dates)
- There should be a "back" button on events (this was handled by using the "home" button)
- jQuery can be used for animation (easy scripts and open source files can be found online.)
- We need to begin working on a chart builder (for pie charts on friend group information)
