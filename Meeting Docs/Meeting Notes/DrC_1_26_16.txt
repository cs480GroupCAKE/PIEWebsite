Meeting Notes
Start Time: 4pm

Notes for the site:
- May want to add the option to sign up for google (for calendar API - could use "hasGoogle" boolean in user database)
- Dropdown menus should be used for all areas where date is entered (to prevent invalid dates)
- Next Steps:
  - PIE chart
  - Database queries
  - Adding deals
  - Pending events tab (could be added to event slider with options to accept/deny)
- Profile needs to be editable - can use jQuery/JS to do it on the same page
- Considered "multistage" events; admin should probably have the right to accept event timing to prevent confusion
  - Users should be able to add comments to events so they can be altered by the admin
- We could add a "recurring events" section to the user database for recurring events
- Next Dr. Chueh meetings will be in Hebeler (meet outside of 218)

Next meeting scheduled January 27, 2016 at 4pm with Dr. Lulofs, Hebeler 208

End Time: 4:35pm
